  about: `I am a software developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. 
   I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. 
   I am a motivated student with a huge computer background. I created my first website in 2015 using Wix. 
   I have successfully completed several web projects from scratch. 
   Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
   So, I have also gained knowledge of Node JS, C# & .Net, Mongo DB, Python,
   firebase and with time.
